# Hive Mind Search Skill

Search the hive mind knowledge store and load relevant prior knowledge before acting.
Prefer searching over reading files directly — the index ranks by relevance, so you load
the right context on the first try.

Search is backed by **qmd** over the `hive-mind` collection, exposed through the bundled
**qmd MCP server**. Use the qmd MCP **`query`** tool to search and **`get`** to retrieve full
notes — that's the preferred surface (no shell-approval friction). Direct `qmd` CLI commands
are the **fallback** if the MCP server is unavailable (see "CLI Fallback" below).

## Prerequisites

- `${user_config.vault_path}` must be configured (path to vault root).
- The qmd MCP server ships with this plugin and registers automatically. If its tools are
  unavailable, fall back to the `qmd` CLI (must be installed and on `$PATH`).

If `${user_config.vault_path}` is empty or the directory does not exist, abort and tell the
user to configure the plugin via `/plugins` → hive-mind → Configure Options.

## Invocation

`/hive-mind:search <query>` — keyword search (fast, exact terms)
`/hive-mind:search <query> --semantic` — vector search (conceptual similarity)
`/hive-mind:search <query> --hybrid` — combined keyword + semantic (best recall)

Default is keyword search. Use `--semantic` when the query is conceptual or phrased as a
question. Use `--hybrid` when precision matters.

## Query types (qmd MCP `query`)

The `query` tool takes one or more typed sub-queries in a single call — the first gets 2×
weight, so lead with your strongest signal:

- **`lex`** — BM25 keywords (exact terms, names, `"quoted phrases"`, `-negation`).
- **`vec`** — a natural-language question (concept / fuzzy recall).
- **`hyde`** — a 1–2 sentence hypothetical answer passage (nuanced topics).

Map the invocation flags: default → `lex`; `--semantic` → `vec`; `--hybrid` → `lex` + `vec`.
Add `vec` (and `hyde`) when keywords miss. Filter with `minScore`. Pass `collections: ["hive-mind"]`.

## ⚠️ De-hyphenate query text (all sub-query types)

De-hyphenate and de-slash `lex` queries — BM25 tokenizes on `-` and `/`:
`trusted-services-lite` → `trusted services lite`, `config/auth` → `config auth`. (The
CLI-fallback path is auto-normalized by the dehyphenate hook, but write `lex` sub-queries
de-hyphenated anyway.)

Also strip hyphens from `vec`/`hyde` text — not for tokenization, but because the qmd MCP
`query` parser reads `-` as a **negation operator** (supported only in `lex`), so a hyphenated
token like `hive-mind` or `MCP-first` in a `vec`/`hyde` sub-query **errors**
(`Negation (-term) is not supported in vec/hyde queries`). Write `hive mind`, not `hive-mind` —
embeddings handle the spaced form fine.

## Context-Aware Search (No Arguments or Vague Arguments)

When you invoke this skill on your own — without specific user-provided search terms — do NOT guess at a query based on the user's intent (e.g., do NOT search `"project-name new feature scope"`). Those queries return irrelevant results because the vault contains highly specific notes, not generalized ones.

Instead, use the **repo-context strategy**:

### 1. Derive the repo name from `pwd`

Extract the final directory component of the current working directory.

```
pwd = /Users/judi/code/trusted-services-lite
  → repo_name = "trusted-services-lite"
  → search_term = "trusted services lite"   (de-hyphenated for BM25)
```

### 2. Search by repo name

Call the qmd MCP `query` tool with a `lex` sub-query for the de-hyphenated repo name:

```
query(searches=[{type:"lex", query:"trusted services lite"}], collections=["hive-mind"], limit=20)
```

The vault organizes repo-related notes in `repos/<repo-name>/` directories, and notes include `repos` frontmatter linking to their relevant repository. Searching by repo name surfaces recent sessions, decisions, and context for the project.

### 3. Sort by recency

From the results, prioritize notes with the most recent date in the title.

### 4. Present as project context

Frame the results as "project memories" rather than "search results":

```
Here's my recent memories for trusted-services-lite:

1. **Session: Auth middleware refactor** (2026-03-28)
2. **PR: Add rate limiting to API endpoints** (2026-03-25)
```

### When to use this strategy

- The user says something general like "I want to scope a new feature" or "let's work on X"
- You're self-invoking to gather context before planning or debugging
- `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or contains only the user's intent (not a pointed search query)

### When NOT to use this strategy

- The user passes specific search terms: `/hive-mind:search JWT auth strategy`
- The user asks to find something specific: "search for notes about rate limiting"

In those cases, use the arguments directly as the query (see Argument Parsing below).

## Argument Parsing

The query is everything in `$ARGUMENTS` after stripping any flags.

```
$ARGUMENTS = "JWT auth strategy --semantic"
  → query = "JWT auth strategy"
  → mode = semantic (vec)

$ARGUMENTS = "how to handle session tokens"
  → query = "how to handle session tokens"
  → mode = keyword (lex, default)
```

## Search Execution

### 1. Build and run the query (qmd MCP `query`)

Pick sub-query types from the invocation mode, de-hyphenate `lex` text, then call the
qmd MCP `query` tool with `collections: ["hive-mind"]`:

- **Keyword (default)**: `searches=[{type:"lex", query:"<de-hyphenated query>"}]`
- **Semantic** (`--semantic`): `searches=[{type:"vec", query:"<natural-language question>"}]`
- **Hybrid** (`--hybrid`): `searches=[{type:"lex", query:"..."}, {type:"vec", query:"..."}]`

Each hit returns a title, file path, score, and a snippet.

### 2. Filter results

- Drop `lex` hits scoring < 0.50.
- Drop `vec` hits more than 15% below the top `vec` score.
- Drop structural/template files (`CLAUDE.md`, `TAGS.md`, `FRONTMATTER.md`, any `index.md`).
- Or pass `minScore` to the tool.

### 3. Retrieve full notes before relying on them

Read any note that looks relevant with the qmd MCP `get` tool — don't answer from snippets:

```
get("<file path from the result>")
```

`get` supports a line offset (`path.md:100`) and there's a `multi_get` tool for batch retrieval.

### 4. Freshness check (if results are empty or thin)

Before concluding "nothing found," call the qmd MCP `status` tool. If `needsEmbedding > 0`
(or the `hive-mind` collection's `lastUpdated` predates a note you expect), the index is
stale, not the vault empty. The `PostToolUse` indexer hook normally runs `qmd update && qmd
embed` after any vault write; if it hasn't caught up, run that and retry rather than looping
or reporting "nothing found."

### 5. Present results

Present results as a concise list:

```
My memories for "JWT authentication":

1. **ECA vs Session-Based Auth** (87%)
2. **Setting Up qmd with Bun** (52%)
```

Then offer follow-up actions:

- "Want me to read any of these notes?"
- "Should I search with a different mode?"

## CLI Fallback

If the qmd MCP server is unavailable, use the `qmd` CLI directly (the dehyphenate PreToolUse
hook auto-normalizes `qmd search` queries):

```bash
qmd search "<query>" --json -n 10 -c hive-mind     # keyword (lex / BM25)
qmd vsearch "<query>" --json -n 10 -c hive-mind    # semantic (vec)
qmd query "<query>" --json -n 10 -c hive-mind      # hybrid + rerank
qmd get "<filepath>" --full                        # retrieve a full note
```

## Search Tips

- BM25 tokenizes on hyphens and slashes — search `sqlite vec` not `sqlite-vec`, `config auth` not `config/auth`
- BM25 (`lex`) is best for exact terms, file names, and specific identifiers
- Semantic (`vec`) is best for questions and conceptual queries; combine `lex` + `vec` for best recall
- If `lex` returns nothing, add a `vec` sub-query
- Keep `lex` queries concise (2–6 words); phrase `vec` queries as natural language
- Canonical spellings of team terms live in `${user_config.vault_path}/LEXICON.md` — if a query term looks like a known variant, search the canonical form (qmd aliases resolve many variants too)

## Error Handling

- If the MCP `query`/`get` tools error, retry once via the CLI fallback before flagging to the user
- If both surfaces error, stop immediately and flag to the user
- If no results: check freshness (step 4), then suggest a different search mode or broader terms
