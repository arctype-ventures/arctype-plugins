# Session Note Skill

Extract insights from the current Claude Code session and write a structured
note to hive mind knowledge base.

## Vault Location

The vault path is defined by the `HIVE_MIND_PATH` environment variable.
The qmd collection name is defined by `HIVE_MIND_COLLECTION` (default: `hive-mind`).
The note author is defined by `HIVE_MIND_AUTHOR` (a wikilink to a `people/` entry).

If any of the vars are unset, abort and flag to the user.

## Invocation Modes

**Full session** — `/hive-mind:session-note`
Extract all notable insights from the entire session.

**Focused** — `/hive-mind:session-note <focus>`
Extract insights related only to the specified focus area.
The focus text is available as `$ARGUMENTS`.

When `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, filter extraction to ONLY content relevant
to that focus. Ignore session activity unrelated to the focus.

## Repository Resolution

Determine the target repo directory dynamically from the current working
directory and the vault structure.

### 1. Extract repo slug from `pwd`

Use the basename of the current working directory (or its git root) as
the repo slug. Use the name exactly as-is — do not strip suffixes or
transform it.

### 2. Find the matching vault directory

Look for the sessions directory for the repo slug under `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/repos`:

```bash
SESSIONS_DIR="$HIVE_MIND_PATH/repos/<repo-slug>/sessions"
```

- If the directory exists: use it as the target directory (`$SESSIONS_DIR`).
- If it does not exist: flag to the user and do not proceed with writing the note.

### 3. Derive project name

Look up the project name from the repo-to-project mapping table in `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/PROJECTS.md`:

```bash
PROJECT=$(grep -E "^\| *<repo-slug> " "$HIVE_MIND_PATH/PROJECTS.md" | sed 's/.*| *//;s/ *$//')
```

If no match is found, leave the `project:` field empty and flag to the user.

The repo slug (from step 1) is used to build a wikilink for `repo:`:

```yaml
repo: "[[repos/<repo-slug>/<repo-slug>|<repo-slug>]]"
```

The looked-up project name populates `project:` as a plain string.
There is no corresponding tag for either field.

## Valid Tags

All tags MUST exist in `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/TAGS.md`. Read that file every
time you generate a note — do not rely on a cached or hardcoded list.

### Tag Rules

- Include 1-5 domain tags that describe the technical subject matter.
- If a tag you need is not in TAGS.md, apply the three-check protocol
  defined in the "Adding New Tags" section of TAGS.md:
  1. No existing tag covers the concept (check for synonyms/broader tags)
  2. The tag plausibly applies to 2+ notes
  3. The tag follows naming conventions
- If the tag passes all checks, add it to TAGS.md with a scope
  description, then use it in the note.
- If it fails any check, fall back to the closest broader existing tag.

## Extraction Process

Review the full conversation context (it is already loaded — do NOT attempt
to parse JSONL transcript files). Then extract ONLY the following categories.
Skip any category that has nothing meaningful to report.

### 1. Learnings

New information discovered during the session. Things the user (or agent)
did not know before and now does. Examples:

- "Locker Service prevents LWCs from accessing parent frame session tokens"
- "pytest-xdist requires `--forked` flag on macOS for module isolation"
- "Salesforce Connected Apps support JWT Bearer Flow without user interaction"

Write each learning as a standalone, self-contained statement. Someone
reading this note 6 months from now should understand the learning without
needing the session context.

### 2. Decisions

Choices made during the session that affect architecture, implementation
strategy, tooling, or approach. For each decision, capture:

- **What** was decided
- **Why** it was chosen (over alternatives if discussed)
- **Impact** — what does this change or constrain going forward

Example:

> Chose JWT Bearer Flow over VisualForce Session ID for off-platform auth
> because VF pages can't be embedded in external sites without iframe
> restrictions. This means each customer org needs a Connected App configured.

### 3. Code Patterns

Reusable patterns, snippets, or techniques discovered or created. Only
include patterns that are:

- Non-obvious (not a basic CRUD operation)
- Reusable (would apply in similar situations)
- Worth remembering (solves a specific problem)

Include a short code block with the pattern and a 1-2 sentence explanation
of when to use it. Strip repo-specific variable names in favor of
generic ones where possible.

### 4. Problems Solved

Bugs fixed, errors resolved, or blockers unblocked. For each, capture:

- **Symptom** — what was broken or failing
- **Root cause** — why it was happening
- **Fix** — what resolved it

Only include problems where the root cause was non-obvious or the fix
is worth remembering. Skip trivial typos and syntax errors.

## Output Format

Use the template from `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/templates/session-note.md` as the
structural starting point. Populate each section following these guidelines:

- **Title**: Concise title summarizing the session focus
- **Context paragraph** (optional): 2-3 sentences on what the session was about
  at a high level. Only include if helpful for future discovery.
- **Learnings**: Bulleted list of standalone, self-contained statements.
- **Decisions**: One H3 per decision. Include what, why, and impact.
- **Code Patterns**: One H3 per pattern. Include a short code block and a 1-2
  sentence explanation of when to use it.
- **Problems Solved**: One H3 per problem. Each with **Symptom**, **Root cause**,
  and **Fix** fields.

Omit any section that has no content. Do not include empty sections.

## File Naming

`YYYY-MM-DD-session-<slug>.md`

The slug should be 2-4 hyphenated words derived from the primary topic.

Examples:

- `2026-02-21-session-jwt-auth-strategy.md`
- `2026-02-21-session-batch-apex-debugging.md`
- `2026-02-21-session-docker-compose-refactor.md`

## Writing Rules

- Be concise. Each bullet or paragraph should be 1-3 sentences max.
- Write for future-you, not present-you. Include enough context to be
  useful in 6 months without the original session.
- Use [[wikilinks]] to reference existing vault notes discovered in step 6.
  Use the pre-formatted `[[path|Title]]` syntax from the linking context.
  Do not guess at links — only link to notes confirmed to exist by search.
- Do NOT include a chronological recap of the session. This is not a
  summary — it is an extraction of durable knowledge.
- Do NOT pad sections to fill space. A note with only Learnings and one
  Decision is better than a note with empty boilerplate.

## Execution Steps

1. Read `$ARGUMENTS` to determine mode (full vs focused).
2. Determine repo slug from `pwd` (basename of working directory or git root).
3. Resolve vault path from `$HIVE_MIND_PATH`. Find the repo's sessions directory
   by checking `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/repos/<repo-slug>/sessions` exists.
   Look up the project name from `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/PROJECTS.md`.
4. Read `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/TAGS.md` and `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/templates/session-note.md`
   to get the current valid tag list and the note template. Use the template as
   the structural starting point for the generated note — it defines the
   frontmatter fields and body sections.
5. Scan current session context for extractable content per the 4 categories.
6. **Discover vault context for linking.** If `qmd` is not installed, skip
   this entire step — the note will be created without wikilinks, same as
   before. Otherwise, execute sub-steps 6a–6f:

   **6a. Extract search entities** — From the extracted content (step 5),
   identify every named entity that plausibly exists as its own vault note.
   Entity types by priority:

   | Priority    | Entity type                         | Examples                        | Always query?    |
   | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
   | 1 (highest) | People / attendees                  | person names                    | Yes — never drop |
   | 1 (highest) | Repositorys                         | repo slugs from step 2          | Yes — never drop |
   | 2           | Glossary terms / internal jargon    | TDS, Command Center, Mascot     | Yes              |
   | 2           | Named tools / frameworks            | qmd, Salesforce Shield, Next.js | Yes              |
   | 3           | Named concepts / decisions          | JWT Bearer Flow, ECA auth       | If distinctive   |
   | 4 (lowest)  | Generic agenda items / action items | "review PR", "update docs"      | Drop first       |

   No hard cap on query count. The entity count in the content is the
   natural bound. Soft ceilings per note type:
   - **Session notes**: ~8 BM25 queries typical
   - **Meeting notes**: ~15 BM25 queries (every attendee gets a query, no exceptions)
   - **General notes**: follow session note guidance

   If approaching the soft ceiling, drop priority 4 and 3 entities first.
   **Never drop a person or repo query.**

   **6b. BM25 query formatting — CRITICAL**

   > **WARNING: BM25 tokenizes on hyphens and slashes.** This vault is full
   > of hyphenated content. Failing to de-hyphenate queries will produce
   > poor or empty results.
   >
   > **Always convert hyphens and slashes to spaces before running BM25
   > queries:**
   >
   > | What you want to find              | Wrong query             | Correct query           |
   > | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
   > | Notes about trusted-services-lite  | `trusted-services-lite` | `trusted services lite` |
   > | Notes tagged salesforce/lwc        | `salesforce/lwc`        | `salesforce lwc`        |
   > | Notes about jwt-auth               | `jwt-auth`              | `jwt auth`              |
   > | Notes about session-token handling | `session-token`         | `session token`         |
   >
   > This does NOT apply to semantic search — the embedding model handles
   > hyphens and compound terms naturally.

   **6c. Run searches** — Two search strategies, used together:

   **BM25 (per entity)** — One query per named entity from 6a:

   ```bash
   qmd search "<de-hyphenated entity>" --json -n 5 -c $HIVE_MIND_COLLECTION
   ```

   **Semantic (one pass for primary topic)** — One `vsearch` query for
   the note's overall topic, phrased as a natural language concept:

   ```bash
   qmd vsearch "<conceptual description of the note's topic>" --json -n 5 -c $HIVE_MIND_COLLECTION
   ```

   The semantic query should be a 5–15 word natural language description,
   not a keyword list. Example: "authentication strategy for external
   Salesforce API callouts" rather than "auth salesforce api".

   If total BM25 hits across all entity queries already exceed 8 unique
   notes, the semantic pass may be skipped — the vault has been adequately
   sampled.

   No `qmd update` here — that runs in the final step after the note is
   written.

   **6d. Build linking context** — From combined BM25 + semantic results,
   deduplicate by path and discard:
   - Results with BM25 score < 0.50
   - Semantic results >15% below the top semantic score
   - Structural files (CLAUDE.md, TAGS.md, FRONTMATTER.md, any `index.md`)
   - Template files

   For each remaining result, record:
   - Title, vault path (strip `qmd://vault/` prefix and `.md` extension)
   - Pre-formatted wikilink: `[[<vault-path>|<title>]]`
   - Tags (from the result metadata, or run `qmd get "<filepath>" -l 20`
     for 2–3 top results to read their frontmatter tags)
   - Brief relevance note explaining why this result relates to the new note

   Note which domain tags recur across related notes — this is a signal
   (not a directive) for tag selection in step 8.

   **6e. Duplicate detection** — If any result has a title or topic that
   closely matches the note being created (same repo, overlapping
   subject matter), flag it:

   > **Potential duplicate detected**: `[[path|Title]]` covers a similar topic.

   Present the warning to the user and ask whether to:
   1. Proceed with creating a new note
   2. Update the existing note instead
   3. Merge content from both

   Do NOT silently create a duplicate.

   **6f. Use context during generation** — Carry the linking context into
   step 7. During note generation:
   - Insert `[[path|Title]]` wikilinks where the note's content naturally
     references a related note's topic. Link on first mention only.
   - When a glossary term is found (result has `type: term`), wikilink
     to it on first mention using `[[glossary/<slug>|<Title>]]`.
   - Place links in running prose, not in a separate section. Example:
     "This builds on the approach from [[repos/trusted-services-lite/2026-02-21-session-eca-vs-session-auth|ECA vs Session Auth]]."
   - Do not force links. A note with zero wikilinks is better than a note
     with irrelevant ones.
   - Do not add a separate "Related Notes" or "See Also" section.

7. Generate the note content following the output format. Use the linking
   context from step 6 to insert `[[wikilinks]]` to related vault notes
   where the content naturally references their topics. Link on first
   mention only; do not add a separate "Related Notes" section.
8. Validate that ALL tags in frontmatter exist in `$HIVE_MIND_PATH/TAGS.md`.
   For any tag that doesn't exist, apply the three-check protocol from
   TAGS.md. If it passes, add the tag to TAGS.md and keep it. If it fails,
   replace it with the closest broader existing tag. Cross-reference domain
   tags observed on related notes in step 6d. If a recurring tag from
   related notes is relevant to the new note and was not already selected,
   consider adding it (still subject to the 2–5 tag limit). Use related
   notes' tags as a weak signal — do not blindly copy them.
9. Determine target directory:
   - Use the path found by `find` in step 3.
   - If no repo directory was found → flag to user and do not continue.
10. Write the file to the target directory.
11. Update the qmd index so the new note is immediately searchable:
    ```bash
        qmd update 2>/dev/null && qmd embed 2>/dev/null
    ```
    If `qmd` is not installed, skip silently.
12. Report to the user: file path, title, which sections were populated,
    the number of wikilinks added, and which notes were linked.
